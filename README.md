[Spigot Plugin] In Progress RPG Server plugin

## What is spigot?
A spigot plugin is an add-on for a game server. This game server called Spigot is a modified Minecraft server which provides functionality for these plugins as well as extras.
> This provides additional performance optimizations, configuration options and features, whilst still remaining consistent with Vanilla Minecraft game mechanics.

## What is this RPG-Server?
This plugin is something I am in the progress of building in my free time.
I have a trello set up to see my current progression and desired features (https://trello.com/b/3JFr5Ztf/rpg-server)

The main idea is for a RPG based server compared to the typical survival. This will feature elements like classes, guilds, boss fights, etc.
For more information please visit the trello linked above.
